\title{A Semi-Markov Approach to Study a Group of Kinesin Motors}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We propose a general mathematical and computational approach to study cellular transport driven by a group of kinesin motors. It is a framework of multi-scale modeling that integrates kinetic models of a single kinesin motor, including detachment and reattachment events, to study group behaviors of several motors. By formulating the problem as a semi-Markov process and applying a central limit theorem, asymptotic velocity and diffusivity can be readily calculated, which offers considerable computational advantage over Monte Carlo simulations in tasks such as parameter sensitivity analysis and model selection. We demonstrate the method with some examples and illustrate the importance of capturing the intrinsic microscopic-level dynamics of individual motors and how changes at the microscopic level propagate to the motor-cargo complex at a mesoscopic level. Particularly, we showcase an example in which difference in the second moment of single-motor characteristic gives arise to different first moment characteristics of the motor group.  \emph{JF: why are we limited to kinesin motors?}

\section{Introduction}

Active intracellular transport is vital for the proper functioning of a biological cell \cite{howard2001mechanics}. Passive diffusion is inadequate for long-distance transport of large cellular cargo, such as vesicles and organelles. Eukaryotic cells evolved an active transport system involving motor proteins which move along a track called microtubules (MTs) towing assorted cargo to needed locations. Kinesin is one such motor protein. A kinesin has two motor domains, typically called heads, which can bind to the MT and both bind and hydrolyze ATP and  \cite{Muthukrishnan2009, Hancock}. By utilizing the energy from ATP hydrolysis, a kinesin ``walks'' on the MT towards the plus end using its two heads in a hand-over-hand fashion, undergoing a sequence of tightly coupled mechano-chemical transitions. Many studies have been conducted on single motors and given us a good understanding of its function in isolation \cite{Block2007,Visscher1999}. The sequence of mechano-chemical transitions are described by kinetic models and are often formulated as a continuous-time Markov chain \cite{Clancy2011}. It is known that at least some of the transition rates are force dependent \cite{Visscher1999}. In addition to Markov chain models, models that explicitly takes into account the microscopic diffusion of motor heads have also been proposed \cite{Kutys2010,Knoops2018}. 

In cellular environments, molecular motors work in groups to transport cargo \cite{Vershinin2007}. Motors are linked to a common cargo through their tail domains, forming a motor-cargo complex. When motors in the group drift apart, tension builds up between them; this tension is resolved through either detachment-reattachment from-to (LF:?) the MT or force-induced changes in the stepping rates of individual motors. In this sense, their motion is coupled together through the cargo, keeping the complex together. When opposing motors are attached to a single cargo, intriguing bidirectional movements are sometimes observed which have triggered substantial interest in studying cellular transport by multiple coupled motors \cite{Hancock2014, Welte2004, Muller2008b, Miles2017a}. Although there have been many experimental and theoretical studies, it remains unclear how to incorporate our understanding of a single motor to inform the behavior of  motor-cargo complexes. 
% 
Stochastic modeling has a fruitful history in generating insight into the mechanisms of cellular transport \cite{Bressloff2013}. In previous modeling studies on multiple motors, the details of underlying kinetics of individual motors and how the cargo load is shared between them have often been overlooked \cite{Miles2018a,McKinley2012,Ohashi2019}. In this work, we propose a computational approach to study a group of molecular motors which takes into account microscopic details of individual motors. We assume that loading forces shared between motors are dependent on their relative positions. We focus on kinesin since its molecular mechanisms are better understood than dynein, allowing us to incorporate existing kinetic models into the framework we will present. By formulating the problem as a semi-Markov process and invoking a functional CLT, asymptotic quantities for the position of the motor-cargo complex can be easily calculated by a few computationally-modest matrix operations. 

The paper is outlined as follows. We first describe the semi-Markov approach in general.  Then, we show how this framework can be applied to motor-cargo complexes. Taking advantage of its computational efficiency, we then conduct a study of the system with a wide range of parameter choices. 

\section{Semi-Markov Framework for Molecular Motor Models}

In this section, we review a previously established framework for molecular motor models that summarizes each kinetic cycle by the time it takes and the resulting displacement \cite{Hughes2011,Hughes2012}, and then use a central limit theorem (CLT) to establish asymptotic quantities for quantities typically measured in experiments.  The goal of this paper is to generalize this technique to motor-cargo complexes.

 We will define a cycle somewhat abstractly and then fill in details with specific examples.  The CLT for the position process involves sums of both the change in position of the motor-cargo complex during the $i$th cycle, which we will denote $Z_i$, as well as the time of the $i$th cycle, which we will denote $\tau_i$.  We will also need to carry some auxiliary information from one cycle to the next which is denoted by $S_i$; one important aspect of the methods presented here is that $S_i$ will form a Markov chain irrespective of $Z_i$ and $\tau_i$.

The Markov chain $\{S_{i}\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $S_{i}$
represents the relative position and a representation of the kinetic state of each motor (together called the ``group state'' henceforth)  at ``time'' $i$. Note that the representation of the kinetic states by $S_{i}$ should be decided carefully on a case by case basis as we will illustrate in examples.   We adopt an underlying kinetic model for each motor which governs how the motor transitions through biochemical states. Note that every time a motor changes its kinetic state, the relative position only changes if this transition results in a physical step. Let $\tau_{i}$ be the time for the transition of $S_{i-1}\to S_{i}$ to happen and $Z_{i}$ be the change in the group position defined as the arithmetic average of positions of all motors resulting
from this transition (Figure \ref{fig:diagram}). If we assume the transition from $S_{i}\to S_{i+1}$ follows every change in the group state due to a transition in the underlying kinetic states of individual motors, then $\tau_{i}$ is an exponential random variable. In general, the state space of $\{S_{i}\}$ need not be the set of all possible group states nor does the transition of $S_{i}\to S_{i+1}$ to exactly follow every change in the group state due to the individual motors' kinetic transitions.  This flexibility will sometimes simplify the calculation as we will see later. 

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1]{diagram.pdf}}
\caption{\label{fig:diagram}Transition graph where arrows indicate dependence. In our model, $S_i$ is the state of the motors in the group, $Z_i$ is the position of the motor group and $\tau_i$ is the time it takes for the transition from $S_{i-1}$ to $S_{i}$.}
\end{figure}


Let $X(t)$ be the position of the motor-cargo complex at time $t$. Using the variables defined above, we can write $X(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)}Z_{i}$ where $N(t)=\inf\{n\in\mathbb{N}:\sum_{i=1}^{n}\tau_{i}\ge t\}$ (LF:?). Two quantities commonly observed in experiments and studied theoretically
are asymptotic velocity and effective diffusivity, i.e., $V=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{E[X(t)]}{t}$
and $D=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\text{Var}[X(t)]}{2t}$. Since many experimental observations of motors occur at significantly long time and distance in contrast to microscopic motor dynamics, from a CLT point of view, the position process will appear essentially like a Brownian motion. To make it precise, we want to place a multi-motor model into a framework of semi-Markov processes so that these two asymptotic quantities of interests can be easily calculated from a functional CLT. Towards this goal, we consider
the discrete-time Markov chain 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}Z_{i}\\
\tau_{i}\\
S_{i}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
for which we impose the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate} %roll back notation
\item $S_{i}$ is an aperiodic discrete Markov chain and has a stationary distribution on a finite state space.
\item The first two moments of $(Z_i, \tau_i)'$ given $S_{i-1}$ and $S_{i}$, are finite and can be computed.
\item the dependence between variables are indicated by the graph in Figure \ref{fig:diagram}, particularly we need the Markov property $p(Z_i=z,\tau_i=t | \{ S_j \}_{j\le i-1} )=p(Z_i=z,\tau_i=t | S_{i-1})$ and conditional independence $p(Z_i=z,Z_{j}=r | S_{i}) = p(Z_i=z | S_{i}) p(Z_{j}=r | S_i)$ for $j>i$ and similarly for $\tau_i$.
\end{enumerate}
Scaling time with a factor $n$ and length by $\sqrt{n},$ we have by functional
CLT 
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(X(nt)-Vnt\big)\Rightarrow\sqrt{2D}B(t)
\]
as $n\to\infty$ where $B(t)$ is standard Brownian motion. The asymptotic
quantities can be calculated using a modified functional CLT (see
derivation in \cite{Hughes2011}) so that we have
\begin{equation}
V=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{E[X(t)]}{t}=\frac{\mu_{z}}{\mu_{\tau}}\label{eq:V}
\end{equation}
 and 
\begin{equation}
D=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\text{Var}(X(t))}{2t}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\mu_{Z}^{2}\sigma_{\tau}^{2}}{\mu_{\tau}^{3}}+\frac{\sigma_{Z}^{2}}{\mu_{\tau}}-2\frac{\mu_{Z}\sigma_{Z\tau}}{\mu_{\tau}^{2}}\right)\label{eq:D}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{Z},\mu_{\tau},\sigma_{Z}^{2},\sigma_{\tau}^{2}$ and $\sigma_{Z\tau}^{2}$ are  means and (cov-)variance arising from the application of functional CLT (see appendix for detailed derivation). The
application of a functional CLT in obtaining asymptotic quantities in studying
molecular motors dates back to \cite{Hughes2011,Krishnan2011} and semi-Markov
processes were introduced in \cite{Hughes2012} to study variable
step sizes. Here we extend this method to a group of motors. Other approaches to study groups of motors include \cite{Miles2017a,Miles2018a}.

\subsection{Two Examples}
We illustrate the use of the semi-Markov approach by applying it to two
kinetic models. First, we state the common modeling assumptions. Let
$m$ be the number of motors linked by a linear spring with constant
$k_{i}$ to a common cargo which equilibriates instantaneously. It
should be noted that the cargo is modeled as not having Brownian forces
acting on it---which is not really the case---but also not an unreasonable assumption---effectively
we are averaging a fast cargo. Similar approximation has been made in \cite{Peskin2000,Fricks2006,McKinley2012}. Each of the motors walks on a MT without
direct interactions with others, i.e., the only coupling is via the
common cargo. Motors can detach and reattach to the MT. Motors share
the loading force $F$ by force balance 
\[
F=\sum_{j=1}^{m}k_{j}x_{j},
\]
where $x_{i}$ are the displacements of the spring connecting to the
i-th motor ($x_{i}>0$ for displacements in the hindering(?) direction
and $x_{i}<0$ vice versa). Hence the loading force felt by the i-th
motor is $k_{i}x_{i}.$ In this modeling framework, the state $S_{i}$
consisting of 
\begin{itemize}
\item relative positions of $m$ motors (Here we take it exactly as $\{x_{i}\}_{i\in1...m}$
though some slack regime possibly exists, where the displacement between the motor and the cargo does not induce any force from the connecting spring. {\bf JF: what does slack regime mean. LH: is this explanation ok?} ) 
\item their kinetic states (including detachment as a state). 
\end{itemize}
Moreover, in the kinetic model we wish to adopt, at least one of the
transitions is force-dependent and its rate is thus affected by which motors are coupled to that motor(?). In the following, we present details on how to apply this approach through some examples. 

\subsubsection{A Standard 3-state Motor Model}

We consider a standard 3-state model of a single kinesin stepping \cite{Andreasson2015}
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 & E\\
\swarrow &  & \nwarrow\\
A & \rightleftharpoons & B & \to & C & \to & A(+1)
\end{array}
\]
where $A$ represents the state of one head bound and the other awaiting
for ATP binding, $B$ represents ATP bound state, $C$ is two heads
bound state and $E$ is the detached state. For simplicity, we only
include forward stepping. Transition $B\to C$ represents the configuration
change where the unbound head docks and attach to the binding site.
So it is reasonable to make this step force dependent, where we assume
a Bell's law dependence. 

We assume there are two motors in a group for simplicity. In this
case, $S_{i}=(x_{1}-x_{2},K_{1},K_{2})$ where $K_{1},K_{2}$ are the chemical states of motors 1 and 2 and take values in the set $\{A,B,C,E\}$.
$S_{i}$ transitions to $S_{i+1}$ every time one of the motor makes
a kinetic transition. We can verify that $S_{i}$ satisfies the assumptions
we imposed earlier.

In theory, since motors can be any number of binding sites away from
each other, the state space of $S_{i}$ is infinite, which is not
ideal for computer implementation. In reality, the polymer (say DNA
links in DNA orgami experiment) that connects to the motor, though
flexible, should have a contour length that limits how far motors
can be separated. In our implementation, we can use the contour length
information to adopt a strategy to restrict
the state space to be finite. We note that unrealistic far separation is
rare and hence including them would only make negligible differences
in our results. Therefore, we gradually increase the number of possible
configurations from close to far until changes in the calculated asymptotic
results are small. In this way, $S_{i}$ has a finite state space and
its transition matrix can be formed. Moreover it is irreducible and
hence it has a unique stationary distribution. Aperiodicity is easily
seen by tracking the number steps back to certain state. For example, looking at state A, it can take a 2-step loop (A to B back to A) or a 3-step loop (A to B to E to A). The greatest common divisor of 2 and 3 is 1 and hence by definition the chain is aperiodic. 

Assumption 2 is from our modeling setup and readily verified. First we note that $\tau_{i}\vert S_{i-1},S_{i}=\tau_{i}\vert S_{i-1}\sim Exp(\text{\ensuremath{\lambda}})$
where rate $\lambda$ is the sum of rates of all transitions out of
$S_{i}$. Also, $Z_{i}\vert {S_{i-1},S_{i}}$
is 0 if $S_{i-1} \to S_{i}$ does not involve any motor stepping  and $1/m$ otherwise, where $m$ is the number of motors in the group. 

\subsubsection{A More Complex Model with Quasi-stationary Approximation}

One drawback of the previous set-up is that the number of states
grows more than exponentially (factorially?) with number of motors. In experimental studies such as the DNA origami experiments described in the introduction,
only a few motors are involved. So it is less a concern when modeling
those situations. Moreover, we can make a quasi-stationary approximation
to further mitigate the issue. In this case, consider a 4-state kinetic
cycle (e.g. the one in \cite{Hughes2011}) 
\[
\begin{array}{cccccc}
 &  & \swarrow\nearrow & A & \leftrightarrow & B\\
 & E &  & \updownarrow &  & \updownarrow\\
 &  & \nwarrow\searrow & F & \leftrightarrow & C
\end{array}
\]
where $E$ is detached state. In this case, completing a clockwise
cycle means a forward step and vice versa for backward stepping. Although there is flexibility in terms of how
the end (or start) of a cycle can be defined, we have
to be careful in order to use a quasi-stationary approximation. To
make a quasi-stationary argument, we need to identify the rate limiting
transition in the cycle. Say transitions $A\rightleftharpoons F$
is much slower than other transitions then we can think the cycle
as follows 
\[
F(-1)\leftarrow A\rightleftharpoons B\rightleftharpoons C\rightleftharpoons F\rightarrow A(+1)
\]
where we count a forward step whenever transition $F\rightarrow A$
occurs and a backward step whenever transition $A\to F$ occurs. We
only track the kinetic state of the motor that just made a step and
assume that all other motors are in a stationary distribution of $A\rightleftharpoons B\rightleftharpoons C\rightleftharpoons F$.
The number of kinetic states of a $m-$motor system is $2m$, (e.g.
for two motors we have $AS,FS,SA,SF$ where $S$ represents ``stationary
state''. We call this approximation ``qss2''. It drastically reduces
the state space. In this
way, $Z_{j}|(S_{j-1},S_{j})$ is deterministic and distribution $p(\tau_{j}|(S_{j-1},S_{j}))$
is not exponential anymore but it can be found using the matrix computational
method in \cite{Hughes2011}. Moreover, the state space can be further
reduced if all motors are identical. Taking one step further, if we
assume that the mixing time is negligible, i.e., the newly stepped
motor get into stationary distribution instantaneously, then there
is no need to track the kinetic state of motors any more so that the
method can easily handle up to five motors . We call this approximation
``qss1''. 

\section{Modeling Experiments}

In this section, we conduct \emph{in silica} experiments to study various
behaviors of the two models we introduced previously. This extensive
study is made possible thanks to the flexibility and efficiency of
the semi-Markov approach. While Gillespie method simulations could also be carried out, the efficiency of the semi-Markov approach means that we can have extremely high levels of accuracy with significantly less calculation.

\subsection{Standard 3-state Model}

We consider a 2-motor system for simplicity. We adopt
biological relevant parameters found in the literature shown in Table \ref{tab:parameters}. \emph{JF: Where do these come from--my guess is that these are from the traffic paper from will?}
In Figure \ref{fig:FV 1-2-motor}, the single-motor kinetic model gives
a force-velocity curve of a typical sigmoid shape. It can be seen
that the motor is insensitive to small hindering (positive) force
and that the assisting (negative) force only speeds up the motor slightly.
It indicates that there are two regimes: one is force-dependent transitions
being rate-limiting while the other is limited by force-independent
transitions. The diffusivity curve has a similar shape. We found that
a 2-motor system is in general slower than 1-motor system when operated
under assisting or small hindering force, which agrees with previous
studies \cite{McKinley2012}. This indicates that two motors tend to
interfere with each other. \emph{I wonder if interfere is the right word--this sound like they are bumping into each other or something like that.} This is expected considering the characteristics
of the single-motor force-velocity relation, i.e., the leading motor
would be slowed down by the forces caused by the trailing motor while
the trailing motor would not speed up because of the assistance from
the leading motor. However, when the 2-motor system is under heavy
load, they tend to share the load and can go faster than 1-motor system.
We call the force at which the force-velocity curve of the 2-motor
system intersects with that of the 1-motor system the ``compensation
force''. Beyond compensation force, the multiple-motor system is
faster than the 1-motor system. It is an interesting quantity to study
since it may have something to do with optimality of the cell transport, i.e.,
how many motors is optimal to transport certain size of cargo. \iffalse We
also note that including detachment in the 2-motor model makes some
qualitative change in the force velocity curve. The monotonicity of
the force-velocity is lost: it dips down at high assisting force.
It is likely due to the fact that 2-motor system tend to have more
frequent detachment under large force. Since detachment plays an important
role, we consider the model with detachment henceforth.  \fi
\emph{JF: note that you may want to emphasize more the interesting diffusion curve--namely the massive difference in diffusivity at low forces for the one motor--and the fact that is strongly damped out for the two motors--the two motors stabilize diffusion at low force--while having a minimal effect on velocity--seems relevant}

\end{figure}


The second moment is less often studied in experimental studies, because it is expensive to replicate the same experiment many times and is often conflated with experimental error. In Figure \ref{fig:M2},
we show an example in which difference in second moment of the single
motor behavior can give arise salient differences in the first moment
of the group behavior. Since the kinetic model is simple, we can come up with two parameter sets that have same first moment (force-velocity curve) of 1-motor system. The parameter values are summarized in Table \ref{tab:parameters} under the name ``generic kinesin''.  As we can see for a 2-motor system, the force-velocity curve generated by the first parameter set($k_{ab}=500$) differs from that of 
the second parameter set ($k_{ab}=5000$) when the loading force is assisting or small. 
In general, we see that the loading force decreases diffusivity and
that the diffusivities of 1-motor and 2-motor systems tend to converge
at large loading force. It should also be noted that force-velocity
curve alone is not sufficient to identify all parameters of such a
simple kinetic model. To avoid unidentifiability, care should be given
in parameter fitting and model formulation.

sets. Note that second moment of the single motor effects the
first moment of 2-motor complex.}
\end{figure}

Next, we conduct sensitivity analysis for compensation force. We focus
on reattachment rate since information about it is scarce in the literature. \emph{JF: do you have any citations to confirm this?}
We hope our theoretical study will stimulate experimental studies
on this front. \emph{JF: One problem is that this is not an easy thing to study--what kind of study could give us such information.} We also want to find out effects of asymmetry in detachment
in response to the assisting and hindering force on compensation.
We suspect that favorable detachment under assisting load can result
in increase in velocity. As in Figure \ref{fig:fcomp surf}, our results show that asymmetry in detachment rate plays only a marginal role while $k_{det}$ shifts the surface in a larger range. It should
be noted that detachment only happens at state A in our model. Thus
the $k_{det}$ in our model is a different rate from most reported
detachment rates which are first order averages.

\end{figure}

Moreover, our framework made it simple to generates a stationary distribution of
motor configurations (proportion of time the system stays in each
configuration). In Figure \ref{fig:stationary-distribution}, we see
that the distribution is symmetric and centered at zero when two motors
are identical. The symmetry is not a surprise since two motors are
identical. Furthermore, We test the case of a group of two motors
of different types by selecting two parameter sets representing kinesin1
and kinesin2. We find that the distribution skewed to the left indicating
that kinesin1 tends to be ahead of kinesin2. In both cases, variance
of the stationary distribution decreases with loading force.

relative configurations of a kin1-kin1 (left) and kin1-kin2 (right)
group. Bottom: corresponding force-velocity and force-diffusivity
curves }
\end{figure}

By adding zero-attached-motor state as a absorbing state, we can calculate
the expected run length. In Figure \ref{fig:force-run-length},
we notice the force-run length curves are not symmetric, which is
likely due to asymmetric force-velocity response to assisting/hindering
force. However, run length decreases faster with assisting force. It
is possibly due to the large variance of distribution of configuration
under assisting force, i.e., the motor explore the configurations
space more extensive increasing the exposure to more vulnerable situations
that leads to detachment. In general, we observe that run length is
very sensitive to change in $k_{det}$.

\end{figure}





\subsection{Cyclic 4-state Model}

We use an quasi-stationary approximation in our semi-Markov approach
to study a group of 5 motors. This is a proof of concept
since biological evidence that supports quasi-stationary requirements
has yet to be identified. Nevertheless, transitions $A\to F$, $A\to E$,
$F\to A$ and $F\to E$ are assumed to be force-dependent. We adopted
parameters and adapted a revised Bell's law so that the these transition
rates are at least one magnitude smaller than others to ensure validity
of the quasi-stationary approximation. In Figure \ref{fig:qss-FVFD}, force-velocity
and force-diffusivity curves of the 5-motor group generated by qss1
and qss2 are shown with a comparison to Monte Carlo simulation. We see that
in general qss approximation tends to overestimate velocity. But nevertheless
captured the general trend. The mismatch tends to be smaller for large
loading force which is not a surprise since it reduces the detachment
rate making the motor more quasi-stationary. With more effort,
qss2 achieves better approximation than qss1.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have presented a semi-Markov approach to study cellular
transportation by a group of kinesin motors. Given a kinetic model
of a single motor, we can formulate it as a semi-Markov process to
study a group of motors. By applying a functional CLT, quantities
of interests such as asymptotic velocity, diffusivity and mean run
length of the motor group can be simply calculated with a few matrix
operations. \emph{JF: Did the functional CLT aid in the calculation of the mean run length?  I think the fclt doesn't apply when there is detachment.} It offers much better computational efficiency than Monte
Carlo simulations without loss of underlying details of the kinetic
model. It should be noted that second moment results are usually computational
expensive using Monte Carlo simulations due to its slow convergence
with respect to sample size. But it is an very important quantity to
study and plays an important role in pattern formation  \cite{Brooks2016}. 

Moreover, our approach makes extensive parameter sensitivity analysis
feasible, as we demonstrated with two examples. In
the first example, we applied our approach to a standard 3-state kinetic
model. We demonstrated that including detachment introduces qualitative
change into the force-velocity curve. As for diffusivity, we find
that two-motor tends to have smaller diffusivity and loading force
decreases diffusivity. Furthermore, we illustrate an example that
second-moment characteristics at single-motor level impacts the first
moment behavior in the group level: two parameter sets that have same
single-motor force-velocity response but differ in force-diffusivity
predict different force-velocity response of the group. We
hope that this finding will call more attention on second moments
in single molecule experiments. 

We also find that 2-motor systems tend to be slower than 1-motor system
under assisting or small hindering force while faster when under heavy
load. Hence we introduced a concept called compensation force which
is an indicator of the force regime where 2-motor system operate faster than a 1-motor system. It is of potential interests to study the optimality of cargo-motor systems. We did extensive parameter study with the hope to spur more experimental studies on this front. 

\section{Appendix}

Here we show calculation to get $\mu_{Z},\mu_{\tau},\text{\ensuremath{\sigma_{Z},\sigma_{\tau}}}$and
$\sigma_{Z\tau}$ which are needed in (\ref{eq:V}) and (\ref{eq:D}).
To do so, we need consider a related CLT namely 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n^{1/2}\bigg(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\begin{pmatrix}Z_{i}\\
\tau_{i}
\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}\mu_{Z}\\
\mu_{\tau}
\end{pmatrix}\bigg) & \Rightarrow & \begin{pmatrix}U\\
T
\end{pmatrix},
\end{eqnarray*}
where the right hand side is a multivariate normal with mean $\mu_Z, \mu_{\tau}$ and  covariance
matrix 
\[
\Sigma=\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_{Z}^{2} & \sigma_{Z\tau}\\
\sigma_{Z\tau} & \sigma_{\tau}^{2}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Based on assumption1, $S_{i}$ has a unique stationary distribution
$\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}$. Based on assumption2, we know the first two
moments of $(Z_{i},\tau_{i})$ conditioned on $S_{i-1}$,  denoted as
as $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S},\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\tau\vert S},\boldsymbol{\eta}_{ZZ\vert S},\boldsymbol{\eta}_{\tau\tau\vert S},\boldsymbol{\eta}_{Z\tau\vert S}$, and their first moment conditioned on $S_{i-1},S_{i}$, denoted as $\Xi_Z$ and $\Xi_{\tau}$, which are matrices with components  
$$(\Xi_Z)_{\alpha,\beta}=E[Z_i \vert S_{i-1}=\alpha,S_{i}=\beta].$$

It is straightforward that $$\mu_{Z}=\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}'\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}$$
and $$\mu_{\tau}=\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}'\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\tau\vert S}.$$

Next we focus on the first component of $\Sigma$ for which we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Sigma_{11} & = & Var(Z_{i})+2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}cov(Z_{i},Z_{i+k}).
\end{eqnarray*}
By law of total variance, we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(Z_{i}) & = & E[Var(Z_{i}\vert S_{i-1})]+Var(E[Z_{i}\vert S_{i-1}])\\
 & = & \boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}'\boldsymbol{\eta}{}_{ZZ\vert S}-\mu_{Z}^{2},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\boldsymbol{\eta}_{ZZ\vert S}$ is the second moment of $Z$
conditioned on $S$. By law of total covariance, we can find the covariance $cov(Z_i,Z_{i+k})$. To exploit the conditional independence as in Figure \ref{fig:diagram}, we choose to condition on $S_{i-1}$ and $S_i$ so that
\begin{eqnarray*}
cov(Z_{i},Z_{i+k}) & = & E[cov(Z_{i},Z_{i+k}\vert S_{i-1},S_{i})]+cov(E[Z_{i}\vert S_{i-1},S_{i}],E[Z_{i+k}\vert S_{i-1}, S_{i}]),
\end{eqnarray*}
where the first term is zero because of conditional independence  and the second
term is as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
cov(E[Z_{i}\vert S_{i-1},S_{i}],E[Z_{i+k}\vert S_{i-1},S_{i}]) & = & \boldsymbol{1}'  \Pi (R_Z \circ P) P^{k-1} (R_Z \circ P) \boldsymbol{1},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\boldsymbol{1}$ is a vector of all one's, $\Pi=\text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\pi}_S)$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal $\boldsymbol{\pi}_S$, $P$ is the transition matrix of the chain $\{S_{i}\}$, $\circ$ denotes Hadamard product, and $R_Z$ is a matrix with its component as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
(R_Z)_{\alpha \beta} & = & (\Xi_Z)_{\alpha \beta} - \sum_{\alpha.\beta} (\Xi_Z)_{\alpha \beta} p(S_i=\beta \vert S_{i-1}=\alpha) p(S_{i-1}=\alpha),
\end{eqnarray*}

Let $M$ is a $m\times m$ matrix with all entries being $1/m$. We note that
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{1}'  \Pi (R_Z \circ P) P^{k-1} (R_Z \circ P) \boldsymbol{1} = \boldsymbol{1}'  \Pi (R_Z \circ P) (P-M)^{k-1} (R_Z \circ P) \boldsymbol{1},
\label{eq:(P-M)^k}
\end{equation}
which is deduced from the fact that $PM=M$ and $\boldsymbol{1}'\Pi (R_Z \circ P) \boldsymbol{1}=0$. We further note that the
spectral radius $\rho(P-M)<1$ (aperiodicity) so that $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(P-M)^{k}=(I-P+M)^{-1}$.
Hence 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}cov(Z_{i},Z_{i+k}) & = & \boldsymbol{1}'  \Pi (R_Z \circ P) (I-P+M)^{-1} (R_Z \circ P) \boldsymbol{1}.
\end{eqnarray*}

Putting things together, we have found 
\[
\Sigma_{11}=2 [ \boldsymbol{1}'  \Pi (R_Z \circ P) (I-P+M)^{-1} (R_Z \circ P) \boldsymbol{1} ] + \boldsymbol{\pi}'\boldsymbol{\eta}{}_{ZZ\vert S} - \mu_{Z}^{2}.
\]
 $\Sigma_{22}$ has the same expression by replacing $Z$ with $\tau$. To find $\Sigma_{12}$,
we note that 
\[
\Sigma_{12}=cov(Z_{i},\tau_{i})+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}cov(Z_{i},\tau_{i+k})+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}cov(Z_{i+k},\tau_{k}).
\]
Similar calculation using law of total covariance gives 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Sigma_{12} & = & [ \boldsymbol{1}'  \Pi (R_Z \circ P) (I-P+M)^{-1} (R_{\tau} \circ P) \boldsymbol{1} ]  + 
\\ & & [ \boldsymbol{1}'  \Pi (R_{\tau} \circ P) (I-P+M)^{-1} (R_Z \circ P) \boldsymbol{1} ]  + \boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}'\boldsymbol{\eta}_{Z\tau\vert S}-\mu_{Z}\mu_{\tau}.
\end{eqnarray*}
