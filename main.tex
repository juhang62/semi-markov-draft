\title{A Semi-Markov Approach to Study a Group of Kinesin??? Motors}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
We propose a general approach to study cellular transport by a group
of kinesin motors. Our approach can integrate kinetic models of a
single kinesin motor to study the group behaviors of several motors.
By formulating the problem as a semi-Markov process and applying central
limit theorem, asymptotic velocity and diffusivity can be readily
calculated, rendering considerable computational advantage over Monte
Carlo simulations in tasks such as parameter sensitivity analysis
and model selection. We demonstrate the method with some examples
and point out the importance of capturing the intrinsic microscopic-level
noise of individual motors, which can give rise salient impact on
mesoscopic level.

\section{Introduction}

Intracellular transport is important for functioning of a biological
cell. Diffusion is inadequate for long-distance transport of large
cellular cargo, such as vesicles and organelles. Eukaryotic cells
evolved an active transport system involving motor proteins which
move on a track called microtubules (MTs) towing cargo to the desired
positions. Kinesin is one type of the motor proteins. A kinesin has
two motor domains (called heads) which can bind to ATP and MT. By
utilizing the energy from ATP hydrolysis, a kinesin walks on MT towards
the plus end with its two heads undergoing a sequence of tightly gated
mechno-chemical transitions. Many studies have been conducted on a
single motor and yield good understanding of its operation{[}{]}.
The sequence of mechno-chemical transitions are described as kinetic
models and usually formulated as a continuous-time Markov chain\cite{Clancy2011}.
It is known that at least one of the transitions is force dependent{[}{]}. 

In reality, molecular motors usually work in a group to transport
cargo{[}{]}. They are tied to the common cargo by flexible polymer.
When motors in the group drift apart, tension is built up between
them which tends to keep them closer. In this sense, their motion
are coupled together. When motors are moving in opposite directions,
intriguing bidirectional movements are observed which have triggered
substantial interests in studying transport involving multiple motors\cite{Hancock2014}.
Understanding how motors interact and work together is a key step
to bridge knowledge in the cellular level and the molecular level.
Although there have been a lot of experimental and theoretical studies,
how our understanding of a single motor can inform their behaviors
in a group remains unclear. 

Stochastic modeling has a fruitful history in generating insight in
cellular transport\cite{Bressloff2013}. In previous modeling studies
on multiple motors, the details of underlying kinetics of individual
motors and how load is shared between them are often overlooked\cite{Miles2018,McKinley2012,Ohashi}.
In this work, we propose an approach to study a group of molecular
motors which take into account microscopic details of individual motors.
We treat loading force sharing between motors in a realistic way by
making it depend on motors' relative positions. We focus on kinesin
since its molecular mechanisms is well understood so that we can incorporate
existing kinetic models into our framework. By formulating semi-Markov
process and invoking functional CLT , group asymptotic quantities
can be easily calculated by a few matrix operations. 

The paper is outlines as follows. We first describe the semi-Markov
approach and demonstrate examples of its application to two kinetic
models. Taking advantage of its computational efficiency, we then
conduct extensive study with wide range of choice of parameters. Attention
is drawn to some interesting observations. 

\section{Semi-Markov explained}

We consider a Markov chain $\{S_{i}\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ where $S_{i}$
represents the relative position and the kinetic state (together called
``group state'' henceforth) of each motor at ``time'' $i$. We
adopt an underlying kinetic model for each motor which governs how
the motor transitions through kinetic states. Note that every time
a motor changes its kinetic state, the group state changes while the
relative position only changes if the motor makes a transition which
results in a physical step. Let $\tau_{i}$ be the time for the transition
of $S_{i}\to S_{i+1}$ to happen and $Z_{i}$ be the change in the
group position (arithmetic average of positions of all motors) resulted
from this transition. If we assume $S_{i}\to S_{i+1}$ exactly follows
every change in the group state due to the transition in the underlying
kinetic states of individual motors, then $\tau_{i}$ is a exponential
random variable. In general, neither the state space of $\{S_{i}\}$
needs to the set of all possible group states and nor does the transition
of $S_{i}\to S_{i+1}$ to exactly follow every change in the group
state due to the individual motors' kinetic transitions. Being aware
of this sometimes would help simplify calculation as we will see later. 

Let $X(t)$ be the group position at time $t$. Using the variables
defined above, we can write $X(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)}Z_{i}$ where $N(t)=\inf\{n\in\mathbb{N}:\sum_{i=1}^{n}\tau_{i}\ge t\}$.
Two quantities commonly observed in experiments and studied theoretically
are asymptotic speed and diffusivity, i.e., $V=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{E[X(t)]}{t}$
and $D=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\text{Var}[X(t)]}{2t}$. Since experimental
observations of motors occur at significantly long time and distance
in contrast to microscopic motor dynamics, from a CLT point of view,
we are looking at effectively a Brownian motion. To make it precise,
we want to cast multiple-motor model in a framework of a semi-Markov
process so that these two asymptotic quantities of interests can be
easily calculated using a functional CLT. Towards this goal, we consider
a discrete-time Markov chain 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}Z_{i}\\
\tau_{i}\\
S_{i}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
for which we impose the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S_{i}$ has a stationary distribution on a finite state space and
is aperiodic. 
\item conditioned on a sequence $\{S_{i}\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$, the sequence
$\{(Z_{i},\tau_{i})\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ are independent
\item $P(Z_{i}\vert\{S_{j}\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}})=P(Z_{i}\vert S_{i})$ and
$P(\tau_{i}\vert\{S_{j}\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}})=P(\tau_{i}\vert S_{i})$ 
\item first two moments of $Z_{i}\vert S_{i}$ and $\tau_{i}\vert S_{i}$
are finite and known
\end{enumerate}
Scaling time with $n$ and length by $\sqrt{n},$ we have by functional
CLT 
\[
\sqrt{n}\big(X(nt)-Vnt\big)\Rightarrow\sqrt{2D}B(t)
\]
as $n\to\infty$ where $B(t)$ is standard Brownian motion. The asymptotic
quantities can be calculated using a modified functional CLT (see
derivation in \cite{Hughes2011}) so that we have
\begin{equation}
V=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{E[X(t)]}{t}=\frac{\mu_{z}}{\mu_{\tau}}\label{eq:V}
\end{equation}
 and 
\begin{equation}
D=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\text{Var}(X(t))}{2t}=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\mu_{Z}^{2}\sigma_{\tau}^{2}}{\mu_{\tau}^{3}}+\frac{\sigma_{z}^{2}}{\mu_{\tau}}-2\frac{\mu_{Z}\sigma_{Z,\tau}}{\mu_{\tau}^{2}})\label{eq:D}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{i}$ and $\sigma_{i}^{2}$ are mean and variance of $i\in\{Z,\tau\}$,
and $\sigma_{Z,\tau}$ denotes covariance of $Z$ and $\tau$. The
application of functional CLT in obtaining asymptotics in studying
molecular motors first appeared in \cite{Hughes2011} and semi-Markov
processes were introduced in \cite{Hughes2012} to study variable
step sizes. Here we extend this method to a group of motors. We can
find $\mu_{i}$ and $\sigma_{i}$ by using their conditionals on the
stationary distribution of $S_{i}$ (details summarized in the appendix).

\subsection{two examples }

We illustrate the use of semi-Markov approach by applying it to two
kinetic models. First we state the common modeling assumptions. Let
$m$ be the number of motors linked by a linear spring with constant
$k_{i}$ to a common cargo which equilibrates instantaneously. It
should be noted that the cargo is modeled as not having Brownian forces
acting on it---which is not accurate---but not an unreasonable assumption---effectively
we are averaging a fast cargo. Each of the motors walks on a MT without
direct interactions with others, i.e., the only coupling is via the
common cargo. Motors can detach and reattach to the MT. Motors share
the loading force $F$ by force balance 
\[
F=\sum_{j=1}^{m}k_{j}x_{j},
\]
where $x_{i}$ are the displacements of the spring connecting to the
i-th motor ($x_{i}>0$ for displacements in the hindering direction
and $x_{i}<0$ vice versa). Hence the loading force felt by the i-th
motor is $k_{i}x_{i}.$ In this modeling framework, the state$S_{i}$
consisting of 
\begin{itemize}
\item relative positions of $m$ motors (here we take it exactly as $\{x_{i}\}_{i\in1...m}$
though some slack regime possibly exists) and 
\item their kinetic states (including detachment as a state). 
\end{itemize}
Moreover, in the kinetic model we wish to adopt, at least one of the
transition is force-dependent by which motors are coupled. In the
following, we present details on how to apply this approach. 

\subsubsection{a standard 3-state model}

We consider a standard 3-state model of kinesin stepping\cite{Andreasson2015}
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 & E\\
\swarrow &  & \nwarrow\\
A & \rightleftharpoons & B & \to & C & \to & A(+1)
\end{array}
\]
where $A$ represents the state of one head bound and the other awaiting
for ATP binding, $B$ represents ATP bound state, $C$ is two heads
bound state and $E$ is the detached state. For simplicity, we only
include forward stepping. Transition $B\to C$ represents the configuration
change where the unbound head docks and attach to the binding site.
So it is reasonable to make this step force dependent, where we assume
a bell's law dependence. 

We assume there are two motors in a group for simplicity. In this
case, $S_{i}=(x_{1}-x_{2},K_{1},K_{2})$ where $K_{1},K_{2}\in\{A,B,C,E\}$.
$S_{i}$ transition to $S_{i+1}$ every time one of the motor make
a kinetic transition. We can verify that $S_{i}$ satisfies the assumptions
we imposed earlier.

In theory, since motors can be any number of binding sites away with
each other, the state space of $S_{i}$ is infinite, which is not
ideal for computer implementation. In reality, the polymer (say DNA
links in DNA orgami experiment) that connects to the motor, though
flexible, should have a contour length that limits how far motors
can be separated. In our implementation, since the contour length
information is not available, we adopt another strategy to restrict
state space be finite. We note that unrealistic far separation is
rare and hence including them would only make negligible differences
in our results. Therefore we gradually increase the number of possible
configurations from close to far until changes in the calculated asymptotic
results are tiny. In this way, $S_{i}$ has a finite state space and
its transition matrix can be formed. Moreover it is irreducible and
hence it has a unique stationary distribution. Aperiodicity is easily
seen by tracking the number steps back to certain state. 

Assumption 2 is basically semi-Markov property which states that the
next transition only depends on the current state but does not depend
on previous states. 

Assumption 3 is also readily verified. First we note that $\tau_{i}\vert\{S_{j}\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}=\tau_{i}\vert S_{i}\sim Exp(\text{\ensuremath{\lambda}})$
where rate $\lambda$ is the sum of rates of all transitions out of
$S_{i}$. Also, $Z_{i}\vert\{S_{j}\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}=Z_{i}\vert S_{i}$
is 0 if $S_{i}$ has no motors in state $C$ and 1/2 otherwise. 

\subsubsection{a more complicated model with quasi-stationary approximation}

One drawback of our semi-Markov approach is that the number of states
grows factorially with number of motors. In experimental studies,
only a few motors are involved. So it is less a concern when modeling
those situations. Moreover we can make quasi-stationary approximation
to further mitigate the issue. In this case, consider a 4-state kinetic
cycle (e.g. the one in \cite{Hughes2011}) 
\[
\begin{array}{cccccc}
 &  & \swarrow\nearrow & A & \leftrightarrow & B\\
 & E &  & \updownarrow &  & \updownarrow\\
 &  & \nwarrow\searrow & F & \leftrightarrow & C
\end{array}
\]
where $E$ is detached state. In this case, completing a clockwise
cycle means a forward step and vice versa for backward stepping. Although
the end (or start) of a cycle can be arbitrary appointed, we have
to be careful in order to use a quasi-stationary approximation. To
make an quasi-stationary argument, we need to identify the rate limiting
transition in the cycle. Say transitions $A\rightleftharpoons F$
is much slower than other transitions then we can think the cycle
as follows 
\[
F(-1)\leftarrow A\rightleftharpoons B\rightleftharpoons C\rightleftharpoons F\rightarrow A(+1)
\]
where we count a forward step whenever transition $F\rightarrow A$
occurs and a backward step whenever transition $A\to F$ occurs. We
only track the kinetic state of the motor that just made a step and
assume that all other motors are in a stationary distribution of $A\rightleftharpoons B\rightleftharpoons C\rightleftharpoons F$.
The number of kinetic states of a $m-$motor system is $2m$, (e.g.
for two motors we have $AS,FS,SA,SF$ where $S$ represents ``stationary
state''. We call this approximation ``qss2''. It drastically reduces
the state space. However it can be seen that the third assumption
is not met, i.e., $P(Z_{i}\vert\{S_{j}\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}})=P(Z_{i}\vert\{S_{i},S_{i+1}\})\neq P(Z_{j}\vert S_{j})$
(same for $\tau$). For example, if $S_{i}=0AS$, there are four possible
$S_{i+1},$ i.e., $1AS,-1FS,-1SA,1SF$, conditioned on which we have
$Z_{i}=+1,-1,+1,-1$ respectively. It should be pointed out that this
issue arises more generally when the stepping is not the only possible
transition for the pre-stepping states. The way around this issue
is to consider the ``augmented chain'' $\{(S_{i},S_{i+1})\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$
in which transitions of the original chain are now states. In this
way, $Z_{j}|(S_{j},S_{j+1})$ is deterministic and distribution $p(\tau_{j}|(S_{j},S_{j+1}))$
is not exponential any more but it can be found using the matrix computational
method in \cite{Hughes2011}. Moreover, the state space can be further
reduced if all motors are identical. Taking one step further, if we
assume that the mixing time is negligible, i.e., the newly stepped
motor get into stationary distribution instantaneously, then there
is no need to track the kinetic state of motors any more so that the
method can easily handle up to five motors . We call this approximation
``qss1''. 

\section{Modeling experiments}

In this section, we conduct in silicon experiments to study various
behaviors of the two models we introduced previously. This extensive
study is made possible thanks to the flexibility and efficiency of
the semi-Markov approach. 

\subsection{standard 3-state model}

For this model, we consider a 2-motor system for simplicity. We adapt
biological relevant parameters found in literature shown in table\ref{tab:parameters}.
In Fig\ref{fig:FV 1-2-motor}, the single-motor kinetic model gives
a force-velocity curve of a typical sigmoid shape. It can be seen
that the motor is insensitive to small hindering (positive) force
and that the assisting (negative) force only speeds up the motor slightly.
It indicates that there are two regimes: one is force-dependent transitions
being rate-limiting while the other is limited by force-independent
transitions. The diffusivity curve has a similar shape. We found that
a 2-motor system is in general slower than 1-motor system when operated
under assisting or small hindering force, which agrees with previous
studies\cite{McKinley2012}. This indicates that two motors tend to
interfere with each other. This is expected considering the characteristics
of the single-motor force-velocity relation, i.e., the leading motor
would be slowed down by the drag caused by the lagging motor while
the dragging motor would not speed up because of the assistance from
the leading motor. However, when the 2-motor system is under heavy
load, they tend to share the load and can go faster than 1-motor system.
We call the force at which the force-velocity curve of the 2-motor
system intersects with that of the 1-motor system the ``compensation
force''. Beyond compensation force, the multiple-motor system is
faster than the 1-motor system. It is an interesting quantity to study
since it may have something to do with optimality of the cell, i.e.,
how many motors is optimal to transport certain size of cargo. We
also note that including detachment in the 2-motor model makes some
qualitative change in the force velocity curve. The monotonicity of
the force-velocity is lost: it dips down at high assisting force.
It is likely due to the fact that 2-motor system tend to have more
frequent detachment under large force. Since detachment plays an important
role, we consider the model with detachment henceforth. 

Second moment is less often studied in experimental studies. In Fig\ref{fig:M2},
we show an example in which difference in second moment of the single
motor behavior can give arise salient differences in the first moment
of the group behavior. As we can see, the first parameter set(kab=500)
gives monotonic force-velocity curve while we lose monotonicity for
the second parameter set (kab=5000). So the in first parameter set,
force-dependent transition is the dominant rate-limiting step for
the range of force we considered while in the second parameter set
other transitions is rate-limiting when assistance force is large.
In general, we see that the loading force decreases diffusivity and
that the diffusivities of 1-motor and 2-motor systems tend to converge
at large loading force. It should also be noted that force-velocity
curve alone is not sufficient to idnefity all parameters of such a
simple kinetic model. To avoid unidentifiability, care should be given
in parameter fitting and model formulation. 

Next, we conduct sensitivity analysis for compensation force. We focus
on reattachment rate since its information is scarce in literature.
We hope our theoretical study will stimulate experimental studies
on this front. We also want to find out effects of asymmetry in detachment
in response to the assisting and hindering force on compensation.
We suspect that favorable detachment under assisting load can result
in increase in velocity. As in Fig\ref{fig:fcomp surf}, our results
show that asymmetry in detachment rate plays only a marginal role
when using reported kinesin detachment rate. It asserts more influence
on compensation force when we use large detachment rate. It should
be noted that detachment only happens at state A in our model. Thus
the $k_{det}$ in our model is a different rate from most reported
detachment rates which are first order averages. In addition, we notice
that increasing $\delta_{4}$ only decrease compensation force when
reattachment is fast. However, when reattachment is slow, front motor
detachment tends to slow down the system since the system more often
operates with only one engaged motor. (want a regime where asymmetric
detachment helps only when katt is large enough (katt=200,kdet=40
both needs be large)!!

Moreover our framework easily generates stationary distribution of
motor configurations (proportion of time the system stays in each
configuration). In Fig \ref{fig:stationary-distribution}, we see
that the distribution is symmetric and centered at zero when two motors
are identical. The symmetry is not a surprise since two motors are
identical. Furthermore, We test the case of a group of two motors
of different types by selecting two parameter sets representing kinesin1
and kinesin2. We find that the distribution skewed to the left indicating
that kinesin1 tends to be ahead of kinesin2. In both cases, variance
of the stationary distribution decreases with loading force. 

By adding zero-attached-motor state as a absorbing state, we can calculate
the expected run length. In Fig\label{By-adding-zero-attached-motor},
we notice the force-run length curves are not symmetric, which is
likely due to asymmetric force-velocity response to assisting/hindering
force. However run length decreases faster with assisting force. It
is possibly due to the large variance of distribution of configuration
under assisting force, i.e., the motor explore the configurations
space more extensive increasing the exposure to more vulnerable situations
that leads to detachment. In general, we observe that run length is
very sensitive to change in $k_{det}$.

\subsection{cyclic 4-state model}

We use the quasi-stationary approximation in our semi-Markov approach
to study a group of 5 motors. Here what we did is a proof of concept
since biological evidence that supports quasi stationary requirements
is yet to be identified. Nevertheless, transitions $A\to F$, $A\to E$,
$F\to A$ and $F\to E$ are assumed to be force-dependent. We adopted
parameters and adapted a revised Bell's law so that the these transition
rates are at least one magnitude smaller than others to ensure validity
of quasi-stationary approximation. In Fig \ref{fig:qss-FVFD}, force-velocity
and force-diffusivity curves of the 5-motor group generated by qss1
and qss2 are shown with a comparison to MC simulation. We see that
in general qss approximation tends to overestimate velocity. But nevertheless
captured the general trend. The mismatch tend to be smaller for big
loading force which is not a surprise since it reduces the detachment
rate making the motor more quasi-stationary. With some more effort,
qss2 achieves better approximation than qss1.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have presented a semi-Markov approach to study cellular
transportation by a group of kinesin motors. Given a kinetic model
of a single motor, we can formulate it as a semi-Markov process to
study a group of motors. By applying a functional CLT, quantities
of interests such as asymptotic velocity, diffusivity and mean run
length of the motor group can be easily calculated with a few matrix
operations. It renders much better computational efficiency than Monte
Carlo simulations without loss of underlying details of the kinetic
model. It should be noted that second moment results are usually computational
expensive using Monte Carlo simulations due to its slow convergence
with respect sample size. But it is an very important quantity to
study and plays an important role in pattern formation\cite{Brooks2016}. 

Moreover, our approach makes extensive parameter sensitivity analysis
feasible, as we demonstrated with two examples of applications. In
the first example, we applied our approach to a standard 3-state kinetic
model. We demonstrated that including detachment introduces qualitative
change into the force-velocity curve. As for diffusivity, we find
that two-motor tends to have smaller diffusivity and loading force
decreases diffusivity. Furthermore, we illustrate an example that
second-moment characteristics at single-motor level impacts the first
moment behavior in the group level: two parameter sets that have same
single-motor force-velocity response but differ in force-diffusivity
predict salient different force-velocity response of the group. We
hope that this finding will call more attention on second moments
in single molecule experiments. 

We also find that 2-motor systems tend to be slower than 1-motor system
under assisting or small hindering force while faster when under heavy
load. Hence we introduced a concept called compensation force which
is an indicator of the force regime where 2-motor system operate faster
than 1-motor system. It is of potential interests to study optimality
of cargo-motor systems. We did extensive parameter study with the
hope to spur more experimental studies on this front. 

\section{Appendix}

Here we show calculation to get $\mu_{Z},\mu_{\tau},\text{\ensuremath{\sigma_{Z},\sigma_{\tau}}}$and
$\sigma_{Z\tau}$ which are needed in (\ref{eq:V}) and (\ref{eq:D}).
To do so, we need consider a related CLT namely 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n^{1/2}\bigg(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\begin{pmatrix}Z_{i}\\
\tau_{i}
\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}\mu_{Z}\\
\mu_{\tau}
\end{pmatrix}\bigg) & \Rightarrow & \begin{pmatrix}U\\
T
\end{pmatrix},
\end{eqnarray*}
where the right hand side is a multivariate normal with covariance
matrix 
\[
\Sigma=\begin{pmatrix}\sigma_{Z}^{2} & \sigma_{Z\tau}\\
\sigma_{\tau Z} & \sigma_{\tau}^{2}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Based on assumption1, $S_{i}$ has a unique stationary distribution
$\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}$. Based on assumption2, we know the first two
moments of $(Z_{i},\tau_{i})$ conditioned on $S_{i}$ which we denote
as $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S},\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\tau\vert S},\boldsymbol{\eta}_{ZZ\vert S},\boldsymbol{\eta}_{\tau\tau\vert S},\boldsymbol{\eta}_{Z\tau\vert S}$.
It is straightforward that $\mu_{Z}=\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}'\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}$
and $\mu_{\tau}=\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}'\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\tau\vert S}$.
Next we focus on the first component of $\Sigma$ for which we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Sigma_{11} & = & Var(Z_{i})+2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}cov(Z_{i},Z_{i+k}).
\end{eqnarray*}
By law of total variance, we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(Z_{i}) & = & E[Var(Z_{i}\vert S_{i})]+Var(E[Z_{i}\vert S_{i}])\\
 & = & \boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}'\boldsymbol{\eta}{}_{ZZ\vert S}-\mu_{Z}^{2},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\boldsymbol{\eta}_{ZZ\vert S}$ is the second moment of $Z$
conditioned on $S$. By law of total covariance, we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
cov(Z_{i},Z_{i+k}) & = & E[cov(Z_{i},Z_{i+k}\vert S_{i},S_{i+k})]+cov(E[Z_{i}\vert S_{i}],E[Z_{i+k}\vert S_{i+k}]),
\end{eqnarray*}
where the first term is zero because of aussumption2 and the second
term is as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
cov(E[Z_{i}\vert S_{i}],E[X_{i+k}\vert Z_{i+k}]) & = & (\text{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}}}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})'\text{diag}(\pi_{S})P^{k}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1}),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $P$ is the transition matrix of the chain $\{S_{i}\}$. 

We can show that
\begin{equation}
(\text{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}}}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})'\text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S})P^{k}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})=(\text{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}}}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})'\text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S})(P-M)^{k}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1}),\label{eq:(P-M)^k}
\end{equation}
 where $M$ is a $m\times m$ matrix with all entries being $1/m$.
To see this, we let $\boldsymbol{d}=\mu_{Z\vert S}-\mu_{Z}$ and $\Pi=\text{diag}(\text{\ensuremath{\pi_{S}}})$
to simplify notations. We need to use two facts: $\boldsymbol{d}'\Pi M=\boldsymbol{0}^{T}$
and $MP'=M$. We first consider $k=2$ 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\boldsymbol{d}'\Pi P^{2}\boldsymbol{d} & = & \boldsymbol{d}'\Pi(M+P-M)^{2}\boldsymbol{d}\\
 & = & \boldsymbol{d}'\Pi\big(M^{2}+M(P-M)+(P-M)M+(P-M)^{2}\big)\boldsymbol{d},
\end{eqnarray*}
where the first two terms are zero and the third term is also zero
as shown below 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\boldsymbol{d}'\Pi\big((P-M)M\big)\boldsymbol{d} & = & \boldsymbol{d}'\Pi PM\boldsymbol{d}\\
 & = & \boldsymbol{d}'M'P'\Pi'\boldsymbol{d}\\
 & = & \boldsymbol{d}'MP'\Pi\boldsymbol{d}\\
 & = & \boldsymbol{d}'M\Pi\boldsymbol{d}=0.
\end{eqnarray*}
 Thus $\boldsymbol{d}'\Pi P^{2}\boldsymbol{d}=\boldsymbol{d}'\Pi(P-M)^{2}\boldsymbol{d}.$
(\ref{eq:(P-M)^k}) follows by induction. We further note that the
spectral radius $\rho(P-M)<1$ so that $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(P-M)^{k}=(I-P+M)^{-1}$.
Hence 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}cov(Z_{i},Z_{i+k}) & = & (\text{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}}}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})'\text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S})\big((I-P+M)^{-1}-I\big)(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}-\mu_{Z}).
\end{eqnarray*}

Putting things together, we have found 
\[
\Sigma_{11}=2(\text{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}}}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})'\text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S})(I-P+M)^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})-\boldsymbol{\pi}'\boldsymbol{\eta}{}_{ZZ\vert S}+\mu_{Z}^{2}.
\]
 $\Sigma_{22}$ has the same expression for $\tau$. To find $\Sigma_{12}$,
we note that 
\[
\Sigma_{12}=cov(Z_{i},\tau_{i})+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}cov(Z_{i},\tau_{i+k})+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}cov(Z_{i+k},\tau_{k}).
\]
Similar calculation using law of total covariance gives 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Sigma_{12} & = & (\text{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}}}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})'\text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S})(I-P+M)^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\tau\vert S}-\mu_{\tau}\boldsymbol{1})\\
 &  & +(\text{\ensuremath{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\tau\vert S}}}-\mu_{\tau}\boldsymbol{1})'\text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S})(I-P+M)^{-1}(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{Z\vert S}-\mu_{Z}\boldsymbol{1})\\
 &  & -\boldsymbol{\pi}_{S}'\boldsymbol{\eta}_{Z\tau\vert S}+\mu_{Z}\mu_{\tau}.
\end{eqnarray*}
